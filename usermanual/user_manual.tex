%User manuals for the different clients. Directed towards users (includes everyone). Start with subsection here.

%This chapter explains to the user how each client should be used. It starts with the desktop and web clients. These clients are the main clients that can handle the main features. Then comes instructions for the mobile clients that are designed to search for files and tell the server to convert them.

This chapter explains how you use each of the \appName\ clients. First instructions on how to use the desktop and the web clients are presented. These are the clients which provide the most functionality. The mobile clients are more lightweight and offer a subset of the functionality presented by the desktop client. Instructions on using the smartphone applications for \term{Android} and \term{iOS} are presented in their own sections at the end of the chapter.
