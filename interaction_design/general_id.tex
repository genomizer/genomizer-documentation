Since the Genomizer application is first and foremost about handling important 
data, it is crucial to allow the user to be in control but still to protect 
and preserve the data that is already in the system from non-authorized users.
That is why Genomizer uses a log in screen to reassure that only authorized 
personnel can access the server data.

The workflow of Genomizer is intended to be as natural as possible for 
the users and to be easily integrated into their daily work routine.
Furthermore, simplicity is favored, the clean and consistent design 
facilitating the tasks without adding the distraction of any 
unneccessary features.
