%\subsection{Interaction Design}

%The design of the Android application is based on the design proposal suggested by the design team and our aim has been to recreate that look and feel. We did, however, find it necessary to take into consideration some of the Android specific design paradigms which distinguish Android applications from other smart phone platforms. For instance, the design put forth by the design group did not include a so called action bar   to the upper part of the user interface which are used for navigation. However, since these are fundamental to the structure of any Android application, we were inclined to include this feature as a substitute for the slide-in menu described in the original design.

%In the following sub-sections, we will attempt to explain our design desisions.

The \appName\ Android application was designed to allow for a quick search of the database while on the move. It also makes it possible to start processes in advance so that the data is ready when further work and analysis is to be done. The application will also provide a way to continuously view the status of active processes on the server. 

The application was designed in close collaboration with the \term{iOS} application in order to provide a consistent experience on both plattforms.  We did, however, find it necessary to take into consideration some of the Android specific design paradigms which distinguish Android applications from other smart phone platforms. In this section the layout and design decisions will be described.


\subsection{Login view}
There are two textfields available for the user to type username and password and a button to click when user is ready to log in.
This is a popular layout for many login screens and thus a design many users are familiar with.

\subsection{Search view}
The design illustrated in \refer{fig:and_search} show the search view, 
which is also the view the user is presented with upon successful login.
The search annotations are displayed in a list and it is easy to learn how to search.
Scroll bars are used for multiple options and textfields are used for free text. 
At the bottom of the view there is a button to press in order to start the search.

\subsection{Search result view}
The design illustrated in \refer{fig:and_result} show the search result view. 
The result is shown in a list, sorted by experiments. The list displaying search results is large to facilitate usage for user and to take advantage of the screen space. 
It's easy to learn how to navigate the list. 
Scrolling is available if the list is long and if the user clicks on an experiment they are redirected to the experiment view displaying more information about that experiment.

\subsection{Experiment view}
The design illustrated in \refer{fig:and_experiment} shows more information about a specific experiment. 
All files associated with the experiment is displayed here and sorted by type (raw, profile and region).
The button \click{Go to process} at the bottom takes the user to the process view, where the user can process all raw files associated with the experiment.
If no raw files should exist, the button will be disabled.

\subsection{Search settings view}
The design illustrated in \refer{fig:and_search_settings} is showing the view for search settings. 
This is a way for the user to select annotations to be displayed in the search result view.
The user can select annotations by checking the checkbox next to the annotation name and then click the button to save changes.
The changes are stored on internal storage and saved between runs of the application.
If the user has no special requests it is also possible to use default settings. 
This functionality gives the users the possibility to design the search result view the way they want to have it, which often is appreciated.

\subsection{Convert View}
The design illustrated in \refer{fig:and_convert_man} shows the conversion view. 
This view displays different parameters that needs to be set before starting to convert data files. 
The view is clear with headlines and hints guiding the user to what parameters that needs to be set that facilitates the work for the user and also prevents errors from occuring. 
At the bottom of the view there is a button to press to start the conversion when all the parameters are set.
