\subsubsection{Uploading - does not update list automatically}
After adding a genome release the list does not update automatically. \\
\\
Build functionality to render when upload is done. 
\subsubsection{The annotation list can't be sorted}
The annotation list should be re-ordered by clicking on table headers. \\
\\
Rebuild list to match design of GenomeReleaseView. We had some problems as we are using a separate list for the search-bar.
\subsubsection{Sidebar dosen't stay vertical}
The sidebar items goes horizontally when page width is 2480px. \\
\\
CSS the sidebar better. 
\subsubsection{Code duplication in SearchResults and Experiments}
It is possible to add one space as annotation value (and name) \\
\\
The server should check for such faults, otherwise some regex code should go around line 70 in NewAnnotationView
\subsubsection{No warning when closing tab during upload.}
If a upload is in progress, there is no warning when closing the tab and the upload is canceled directly. \\
\\
There are some code for this in view/Upload.js, but it's currently broken.
\subsubsection{Moving backwards in the browser does not hide modal windows}
When navigating to a modal window the URL is updated, and added to the browser history. When using the browser back-button the modal is not closed, but the URL is still updated. \\
