	Bug description & Suggested solution \\ \hline
	Moving forward and backwards in the browser does not hide modal windows. & Modify ModalAC and the router \\ \hline
	If there is an error when adding files to an experiment the experiment collapses so the user won't get a chance to correct it's mistake & Start uploads of files when all files have been added without errors. \\ \hline
	If the authorization token expires the user will be sent to the login screen and any entered input will dissapear. & Show login modal without redirecting to root url and save errorous ajax-request and resend it when the login has been completed. \\ \hline
	The collections SearchResults and Experiments represents the same models. & Merge SearchResults and Experiments to one collection to possibly get a cleaner design. \\ \hline
	If a current upload is in progress, there is no warning when closing the tab currently uploading. & There are some code for this in view/Upload.js, but it's currently broken. \\ \hline
