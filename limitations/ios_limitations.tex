\subsection{Unspecified behaviour on loss of internet connection}
The application is based around having an active internet connection, and may crash if the connection is lost.

\subsection{Lack of security}
Currently, the only security feature is that a valid password is required to log in. All communication is done in plain text. This should be fixed as soon as possible.  

\subsection{No administrative features}
The app does not have any of the administrative functions of the web and desktop clients.
