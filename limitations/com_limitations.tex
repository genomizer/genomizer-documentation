\subsection{HTTP Headers}

There is an issue that causes the response from the server to have multiple HTTP headers. This only happens when upload/download requests are sent.

\subsection{Processing}

A PutProcessingCommands can hold a list of processes to run. It is currently impossible to cancel a single process from this list. The entire list must instead be cancelled.

\subsection{Apiary}

The apiary site does not match the API to 100\%. Some items need further explanation and some inconsistensies exist.
