\subsection{Processing}
The Android in it's current state is limited to just convert/process from raw to profile. The layout for the other processes is the same so implementation of step,ratio and smoothing is not as big of a task. More list has to be created and matching JSON package has to be made. 

\subsection{Convert between file formats}
This function is not yet implemented. 

\subsection{Security}
SSL is not safe in it's current state, right now the application trusts all host. That should be change to trust just the hosts that the application needs.
