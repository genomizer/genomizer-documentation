% When conducting experiments and analyzing data within the epigenetics field, a large amount of data is generated. This data needs to be handled and stored in an easy, secure and efficient way. Analyzing this data is today a very time consuming task, involving several manual steps with little to none user friendliness. These steps might also change and/or be replaced. A system for analyzing and storing epigenetics data safely and efficiently in a single application does not exist today. 

% Within the PVT Project we are developing a system that addresses these issues. The system is built for experienced epigenetic scientists as well as for new users. This system focuses on making analyzing and storing epigenetics data less time consuming and more efficient by gathering these tasks in one common application and by using a database for storing. The system will help users to easily search the database for data. Data from the database could either be used for analyzing just by marking what data to be used or to be downloaded to a local space in a wide variety of different file formats. The database is accessed from multiple devices (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android and iPhone) using separate client applications. 

\appName\ is a system for storing and analyzing \term{DNA}-sequences. It was designed for researchers in the field of epigenetics, who are interested in where on a \term{DNA} string a certain protein binds. In order to get this information, experiments are conducted and \term{raw} data files collected. These data files are then converted, in a series of steps, to files suitable for analysis. \appName\ allows the researchers to upload \term{raw} files to a server and automate the generation of analysis data. 

\appName\ was developed by students at \term{Ume√• University} as part of a project for the course \term{Software Engineering}. This documentation is directed towards three main groups: end users, system administrators and developers.

The first part of this documentation describes the target group for the software. This is followed by instructions on how to use the software. The next section is aimed at administrators and developers and includes instructions on how to deploy the server and software. The final chapters take an in depth look at how the software has been designed and implemented and is aimed at the more inquisitive reader. 

% Finally at the end of the documentation are appendixes that helps describe different parts of the software and the software development.
