\section{Android}
For people who are going to continue the development of the android application there are some things you should know.

The first is that you should setup appcombat v.7 for every user in your group with the right directory under Settings->Android. That is necessary to be able to use git without problems. 

We have used eclipse android but you should check if you can use android studio that has much better support for support libaries that make much things easier. Andoid studio also is build for just android that makes coding much easier, with more help from the enviroment.

A big thing is that the safety of the communication between the application and the server is not done safe. Right now we trust all host with SSL this should be updated and change when the application is out of testing. 

Process is not implemented to it's full, right now only raw to profile works. That layout should be used to implement process for the other steps. It is co-worked with the other client groups.

Testing can allways be done better. We have followed a scheme that checks if things that are supposed to work still work rather that test gui in code. So to build  a such scheme should be a high priority look att acceptance test in \refer{tests}.
