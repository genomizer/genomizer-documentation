A more indepth look at how the system is designed with UML- and class-diagrams. It is divided into two main sections for the server and clients. The client section contains the different clients. After that follows the server section that is divided into different parts that makes up the whole server. 

%\section{Clients}
%Here is an explanation of the  different client system designs.

\section{Server}
The design of the servers system is based around several parts. These parts consists of: communication, conversion, processing, storage and file transfer. Following is a more detailed description of each part.
