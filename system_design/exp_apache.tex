The Apache HTTP Server, or commonly referred to as Apache, is the web server application which is used to upload and download files to and from the server. Apache is open source, which makes it free to use. Apache is a good choice because it is developed and maintained by an open community, that way all new versions and updates will become available for free. Since it is open source, the source code is open for everyone to read. Apache can be used on both Unix/Windows systems. In this case it is running on a Unix machine but can still communicate with all platforms. 

\subsubsection{Server user manual}
The Apache server is controlled from the terminal. This can be done either directly from the server or remotely from another computer using Secure Shell (SSH). To use SSH from another computer, write

\texttt{ssh username@address.to.server}

in the terminal. Enter the password for the server and then write the commands directly in the terminal.
