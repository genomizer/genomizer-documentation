The Apache HTTP Server, or commonly referred to as Apache, is the web server application which is used to upload and download files to and from the server. Apache is open source, which makes it free to use. Apache is a good choice because it is developed and maintained by an open community, that way all new versions and updates will become available for free. Since it is open source, the source code is open for everyone to read. Apache can be used on both Unix/Windows systems. In this case it is running on a Unix machine but can still communicate with all platforms.
