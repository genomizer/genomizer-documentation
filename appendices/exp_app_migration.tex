\section{Introduction}
This manual will present the steps in the process to migrate the \appName\ system to a new server machine. This document will guide an experienced Linux user through the process of a migration from one server machine to a new one. The migration can be seen as a manual backup if the steps below is followed

\section{Steps of migration}\label{sec:exp_steps}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run pg\_dump command on the server machine to migrate. This creates a copy of the database. 
	\item Copy the \emph{/var/www/} folder on the current server machine and save the copy to a removable storage device.
	\item Install the new server machine with operating system and necessary software. 
	\item When installation is done, paste the copied \emph{/var/www/} folder from step 2, to the same location on the new server machine. 
	\item Insert the database copy into the database.
	\item Copy settings.cfg and make sure it is properly set up for the new machine.
	\item Now the system is ready for the first startup. Make sure to have a new version of the \appName\ server.jar on the machine.
