This section contains the implementation of the different parts of the system and what tests has been used to ensure its functionality. Here developers can get an understanding of how and why the different parts of the server was completed.

\section{Clients}

In this section the implementations of the different clients will be described
in more detail. The desktop and web clients are explained in the first two
sections followed by two sections for each of the mobile applications.
