The iOS application has been implemented using Objective C. The decision to use Objective C was made largely because it is the standard language used for writing iOS applications. Libraries and framework that has been used is mostly Apple's standard framework for iOS applications called UIKit. A few custom userinterface objects has been created to better suit our and our customers needs. 

Communication with the server is done with a HTTP REST protocol and JSON objects are sent and received. 

\subsection{Testing}
The logic in the application has been tested with XCTest which exists in the integrated development environment Xcode which has been user during the development. 
The graphical interface has both been tested throughout development both by the developers and by the customers. Furthermore a systemized testscript has been implemented using UI Automation which tests the application in the form of a user and runs through a set of scenarios. UI Automation is an instrument in Xcode which uses scripts written in JavaScript to simulate user interaction with the app.
