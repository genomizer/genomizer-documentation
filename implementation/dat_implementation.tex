The following text describes the different classes the Genomizer server uses to communicate with the database and the file system. All the communication with the database happens through the \class{DatabaseAccessor}-class, which uses several helper classes that contain methods with the actual logic. These relationships are visualized in \refer{fig:dat_overview_schema}.

\subsubsection{DatabaseAccessor}
\class{DatabaseAccessor} is a class that serves as an API for the \term{Genomizer} database - it handles all connections and queries to the database. To counteract data inconsistency the isolation level of the connection is set to \term{TRANSACTION\_REPEATABLE\_READ}. The methods simplify queries to the database by removing the need to write \term{SQL} in any other packages. For more details see the class diagram, \refer{fig:dat_dbac}, in \refer{chap:dat_umls}.

\subsubsection{Containers}
The classes in the \texttt{database.containers} package represents domain specific objects. The \class{Experiment} class contains an experiment's annotations and a list of files. The \class{Annotation} class contains information about the annotation label, whether the label is required or not, the default value of the label and annotation choices for drop down values. The files are contained in \class{FileTuple} objects which stores filename, filetype, filesize, etc. More information can be found in the class diagram \refer{fig:dat_containers} in \refer{chap:dat_umls}.

\subsubsection{Methods}
The \class{DatabaseAccessor} uses helper classes to execute \term{SQL} queries. These helper classes are grouped by their area of responsibility:
\begin{itemize}
\item Annotation methods
\item Experiment methods
\item File methods
\item Genome methods
\item User methods
\end{itemize}
These classes execute the basic \term{SQL} functions create, read, update and delete (CRUD). The use of \term{prepared statements} in these classes (also known as parameterized queries) safeguards against \term{SQL} injection. When modifications to more than one relation are made from a single method, transactions are used to not put the database in an inconsistent state.

\subsubsection{Helpers}
Folders are created for a new experiment when the experiment is added to the database, including subfolders in preparation of files to be uploaded. The creation of folders is handled by the \class{FilePathGenerator} class. All files are then sorted into folders corresponding to experiment ID, except for genome release files that are categorized by species.

The \class{PubMedToSQLConverter} class converts a \term{PubMed} string to a \term{SQL} query. The simplest format for a \term{PubMed} string is \term{value[Label]} but the user can enter the annotation labels and values in combination with the the logical operators \texttt{AND}, \texttt{OR} and \texttt{NOT}. Parentheses are used for disambiguation.
\begin{example}
To search for all raw files that Per created the PubMed string should be:

raw[FileType] AND Per[Author]
\end{example}

Searches can be made on labels corresponding to file attributes as well as experiment ID. Searching for empty string will return all experiments in the database.

\subsubsection{Testing}
WARNING! The unit tests in the \texttt{database.test} package have a database dependency. Do not run any of the tests found in this package on a database that is in use. All tuples are removed from the database upon test completion. Every instance of unit testing should start with an empty database and finish with an empty database to avoid test interdependency.

All the unit tests use the JUnit package and utilize the \class{TestInitializer} class. This simplifies the process of connecting to the test database, filling it with test tuples and clearing the test database and closing the connection when the test class is finished. The individual unit tests can be found in the \texttt{database.test.unittests} package. The scripts for adding the test tuples and clearing the test database tables can be found in the \texttt{sql} package.
